# Title: TIC TAC TOE!
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/gc62OJrZO1E
#### Description: Hi,I'm Sivansi! I'm currently 13 and I'm from India. 

# This project was based on the all-so-famous and basic game "Tic Tac Toe". 

# I decided to add a programmer twist to it and added "login/signup" to it too. 

# On Game Nights, Me, my parents, friends and other family members play multiple games such as monopoly, indian carrom, cards, ludo (another indian game) or just any board game that we have our hands on, but our most favorite sure is Tic Tac Toe.

# We always had quarrels over other taking over our chances and sometimes just because the others are winning too much. This game is so close to my heart, so I decided to make my final project of C550 introduction to pyhton based on it.

# tic Tac Toe seemed a bit basic to me so I decided on adding up login and sign up to it. In my program, the player logs in or signs in and then starts playing tic tac toe. I hope you liked it!

# I started off by importing bcrypt and then adding functions like welcome(), gainAccess(), Register, etc. All of them co-relating to each other. Using if and else in the gainAccess() and Register() function, I made sure that both work perfectly fine and even have an outcome of addressing what's wrong if the person mispells something, has a password too short (under 3 letters/numbers) or if had an unvalid option/parameter given when asked for "login/signup"
